    <h3>Aglio e Olio, also known as Spaghetti Aglio e Olio, is a <br>
        simple yet iconic Italian pasta dish that originated in Naples. <br>
        The name translates to “garlic and oil,” which perfectly represents <br>
        its core ingredients — garlic gently cooked in extra-virgin olive <br>
        oil to create a fragrant, silky base that coats the pasta. Traditionally <br>
        made with spaghetti, the dish also includes chili flakes for heat, freshly <br>
        chopped parsley for brightness, and a splash of starchy pasta water to <br>
        emulsify the oil into a light, glossy sauce. Despite its simplicity, <br>
        Aglio e Olio is celebrated for its deep flavor, achieved by slowly <br>
        toasting thin slices of garlic until they turn a light golden color, <br>
        infusing the oil with their aroma without becoming bitter.
        <br><br>
        Historically, this dish was popular among working-class families because <br>
        it required only a few inexpensive pantry staples. Over time, it also became <br>
        a favorite late-night meal in Italian households due to how quick it is to prepare. <br>
        Today, Aglio e Olio remains beloved both in Italy and around the world as a <br>
        comfort food that highlights quality ingredients and careful cooking technique <br>
        rather than heavy sauces or complex flavors. Although the traditional recipe is <br>
        minimalistic, modern variations sometimes include additions like grated cheese, <br>
        lemon zest, mushrooms, anchovies, prawns, or toasted breadcrumbs, but true purists <br>
        often insist that nothing more than garlic, oil, chili, and pasta is needed. <br>
        The beauty of Aglio e Olio lies in its elegance — a humble dish that proves simple <br>
        ingredients, when treated with respect, can be incredibly satisfying.</h3>
